# THERMAL AND MECHANICAL ANALYSIS

The idea of this repository is to do a thermal analysis, then these results are going to be induced into a mechanical analysis in the form of initial strains. With this you can have a loaded beam for example, and subject it to a gradient of temperatures and see how the beam behaves. Here goes an example:

# How to use:
1. You download the thermal folder, ```functions.py``` & ```runAnalysis.py```
2. You install the required libraries (```pip install tabulate, numpy, scipy, h5py```)
3. Then you only need to open ```runAnalysis.py``` and run the code.

# Observations:
In ```runAnalysis.py``` there are some parameters you can modify depending on what you need.
